model accuracy = garbage
 
The majority of visitors will not make a purchase. We are dealling with a very much imballanced classification dataset.

True postive = 	P -> transaction ; R -> transaction
True negative = P-> no transaction ; R -> no transaction
False positive = P -> transaction ; R -> no transaction
False negative = P -> no transaction ; R -> transaction

Whether we want to minimise the false positives or false negatives really depends on the business decision behind it.

- If there is no business decision made based on the the outcome, one would like to place equal emphasis on minimising both.

- If the business decision made is NOT to offer a discount voucher to a customer who is likely to make a purchase, one would like 
to minimise the false negatives.

False positive = I do not give a discount voucher to a customer who was not going to make a transaction.
False negative = I give a dicsount voucher to a customer who was going to make a transaction anyway.

- If the business decision is to allocate more computer power ressources to a customer who is likely to make a transaction. Knowing that the servers who provide
the power ressources are rented and that the cost associated to it is based on usage, one would like to minimise the false positives.

False positive = I give more computer power to a customer who was not going to make a transaction.
False negative = I do not give a customer more computer power ressources to a customer was going to make a transaction.



As it is not clear what the business decision will be based on this prediciton model, we will place equal emphasis on minimising both.
